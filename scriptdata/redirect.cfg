// Global switch

// 1 = enabled
//set ex_redirect "0"

// The IP:port of the target server
// default = (empty)
set ex_redirect_ip "1.2.3.4:28960"

// How long to display the redirection notice in seconds
// min = 5, max = 60 (default 10)
//set ex_redirect_pause "10"

// Set reason for redirection.
// When set to 1, players still need to pass the full server test
// 0 = full server: redirecting to other server (default)
// 1 = private server (only known clans): redirecting to public server
// 2 = old server: redirecting to new server
// 3 = being serviced: redirecting to other server
//set ex_redirect_reason "0"

// Set logic for full server redirection
// In mode 0 the mod uses the last slot to redirect a client. On a 32 slot
// server, when having 31 players and one redirection in progress, the server
// will be full (showing the server full message, not redirecting) for any
// connecting player, until the redirection has completed. If multiple players
// connect at once, while there are 31 players already, only one is redirected.
// In mode 2 you can reserve more slots for the redirection process by setting
// private clients (server.cfg, sv_privateclients) without a private password
// (server.cfg, sv_privatePassword) set. If you later decide to set private
// client to 0 again, it still behaves like mode 0.
// 0 = redirect if number of players = max clients - 1 (default)
// 1 = redirect if number of players = max clients - private slots
// 2 = redirect if number of players = max clients - private slots - 1
//set ex_redirect_logic "2"

// Clan priority mode
// Redirect existing players to make room for clan player.
// It will always try to redirect non-clan players first, if available.
// Before enabling this feature you should order the clan tags (see clancontrol.cfg)
// clan1 (ex_clantag1) has the highest priority. clan4 (ex_clantag4) the lowest.
// 0 = disabled (default)    - Redirect: connecting player
// 1 = prioritize clan 1     - Redirect: non-clan » clan4 » clan3 » clan2
// 2 = prioritize clan 1+2   - Redirect: non-clan » clan4 » clan3
// 3 = prioritize clan 1+2+3 - Redirect: non-clan » clan4
// 4 = prioritize all clans  - Redirect: non-clan
//set ex_redirect_priority "1"

// Show a hint
// 0 = disabled
// 1 = enabled (default)
//set ex_redirect_hint "1"
